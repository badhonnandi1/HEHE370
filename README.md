# OAA Student Management System

The **OAA Student Management System** is a web-based platform developed for **BRAC University students** to streamline the mentorship process under the guidance of the **Office of Academic Advising (OAA)**.

At the start of each semester, BRAC University assigns mentors to fresher students in a 25:1 ratio to ensure personalized support and guidance. Through this system, each student is paired with a mentor who provides assistance, facilitates two offline sessions, and shares essential resources to support the student’s academic journey.
